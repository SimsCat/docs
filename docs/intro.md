# Getting Started

Ping.gg is the best way to make collab video. Live on Twitch, recorded for Youtube, produced for television, and everything in between.

If you prefer videos, Theo and Adam filmed one below to help you get started quick! Otherwise you can follow along below

<div style={{ width: "100%", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inSIW-m2Oq0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## Streaming Software Setup

Ping is compatible with _any video software that can treat a website URL as a "source"_ (i.e. a [_browser source_](https://obsproject.com/eu/kb/browser-source)). This includes:

- [OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software Studio)](https://obsproject.com/)
- [Streamlabs Desktop](https://streamlabs.com/)
- [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/)
- [Twitch Studio](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio)

While all of these solutions work, we **highly recommend that you use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)**.

We highly recommend using **[nested scenes as sources](/advanced-obs/scene-as-source)**
