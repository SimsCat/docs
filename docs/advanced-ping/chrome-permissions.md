# Enabling Camera and Microphone in Google Chrome

To use Ping, you need to have both your Webcam and Microphone accessible by Google Chrome, and by the off-chance the Chrome does not prompt you at the top of your browser, here is how to enable both devices

- First connect to your desired Ping Room
- Before joining your call make sure that you are able to see yourself in the preview window.

- It seems here that my Camera is not being picked up, and I donâ€™t have the option to add a camera.
- in the top left of your browser, click the **[ðŸ”’](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%94%92/)** icon next to the Address Bar

You may need to refresh your browser after enabling camera/microphone permissions before they will be able to be picked up by Ping.
